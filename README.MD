## INFORMATION ABOUT HOW I MADE THIS GAME AND STUFF
This game was inspired by agar.io and much of the code was based off of a pygame tutorial game known as squirrel eat squirrel, which has similar mechanics. You can see it here:  https://inventwithpython.com/makinggames.pdf (page 200).

Resources used:
- Python 3.6.3
- PyGame
- MS Paint (for the default boss lel)
- My blood, sweat, and tears. Just kidding, only tears.
