-- HOW TO CREATE YOUR CUSTOM BOSS --

I have purposefully made it very easy and simple to create a custom boss. 
For a complete custom boss, you will need SIX files. 

- One preferred image of your boss (Should be a SQUARE image in PNG format) 
- Five .ogg audio files

You must rename your image to "img.png" for it to work properly.
For the audio files, they must be in the .ogg format. You can use the free program 'Audacity' to record or modify existing audio, and export as a .ogg file. 
You need five audio files: 
"eat.ogg" - the sound that plays when the boss eats the player
"eaten.ogg" - the sound that plays when the player eats the boss
"view.ogg" - the sound that plays when the boss comes into screen view
"touch.ogg" - the sound that plays when the boss's rectangle comes into contact with the player
"ohno.ogg" - the sound that plays when the player becomes big enough to eat the boss

To put this new boss into your game is a simple process: 

Step 1: Navigate to wherever you saved the game
Step 2: Go to badgario/data/active
Step 3: Delete the six existing files (We should have a saved copy of the six files in badgario/data/bosses)
Step 4: Copy-paste your six files into that folder (if you decide to cut-paste, remember to save those files somewhere if you want to use a different boss!)
Step 5: Run the game with your custom boss!

In the future, I plan on creating a feature that can change the bosses with the click of a single button. Unfortunately for now, you will have to follow these instructions.
