Added a main menu with three options:
1. Play game - launches the main game

#################################
November 14th 2017
Version 0.0.8

New Feature: Dynamic Player Speed AND New loss condition: You are too fat!
As the player gets bigger, he will also become slower. This is done through a series of stages where when the player passes each size stage, the player loses 1 movespeed.
If the player's movespeed becomes the same or lower than the boss, then he loses because he would never be able to catch up. 

New Feature: Return to Menu
When the player hits 'escape' or 'm', it will return to the main menu screen. 
(note for developers: I have changed the runGame function so that it will return a boolean indicating whether to RETURN TO MENU (True) or RESTART (False))

Changes: 
- All victory/defeat text is gray
- Set it so that the player will be displayed IN FRONT OF the boss when he is larger.

Version 0.0.8B

Cheats added: 
- Press control+'=' to increase your size value by 5. 
- Press control+'-' to decrease your size value by 5. (NOTE THAT DECREASING YOUR SIZE BY CHEATS DOES NOT MAKE YOU FASTER)

Updated README.MD to include special thanks section for my voice actor(s)

#################################
November 15th 2017
Version 0.0.8C

Changes: 
- You can now press 'r' to restart the game no matter if you win, lose, or become too fat.
- Gave the press 'r' to restart text screen to all end-game screens. 

Bug fixes: 
Fixed bug where the Turnaround flag will not happen if you use cheats to increase size. 
Fixed bug where the game will not end after you become too fat, due to the endgame statement being nested in the dynamic speed if statement. 

################################
November 17th 2017
Version 0.0.8D

Changes: 
Added a new color: Turqoise! :D
The default game is a bit too easy, so I made some significant balance changes: 
 - Changed the minimum engulfing size change from +2 to +1
 - Changed the boss size from 200 to 210
 - Changed the staging system 
	- Starting speed changed from 8 to 13
	- Stage separation (The amount of size you must gain to lose speed) changed from 50 to 25
	- You will become TOO FAT at size 250 instead of size 275

Personally, I'm not sure if this makes the game better or worse. I'll get my playtesters to try it out... IF I HAD ANY. :'(
